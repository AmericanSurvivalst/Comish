# CONTENT VOICE

Since these are brand accounts (not personal), use this voice:

```
- Confident but not corporate
- Helpful, practical
- Slightly irreverent ("spreadsheets suck")
- Use "we" occasionally, but often just state facts
- Minimal emoji (🟢 as brand accent, occasional 📊💰)
- No "I" statements - it's the brand speaking
```

**Examples:**

❌ "I built this because I was tired of spreadsheets"
✅ "Built by a rep who was tired of spreadsheets"

❌ "I think every sales rep should track their commission"
✅ "Every sales rep should know exactly what they're getting paid"

---

# ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY

### Twitter (Most Important)
- Reply to sales influencers' tweets
- Quote tweet with insights
- Answer questions in sales conversations
- Use polls for engagement

### LinkedIn Company Page
- Post consistently (algorithm rewards it)
- Reply to every comment
- Company pages get less reach - that's ok

### Instagram
- Use Stories for behind-the-scenes
- Reply to every comment and DM
- Use hashtags strategically

### Facebook
- Lowest priority - just maintain presence
- Repurpose content from other platforms
- Consider joining sales groups and engaging there

---
