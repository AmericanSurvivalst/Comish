# CONTENT VOICE FOR BRAND ACCOUNTS

```
- Confident but not corporate
- Helpful, like a friend who knows commission math
- Slightly irreverent ("spreadsheets suck")
- Uses "we" sparingly, often just states facts
- Emoji: minimal, strategic (🟢 for accent, occasional 📊💰)
```

The spreadsheet every sales rep has:

Commission Tracker.xlsx

**1:00 PM:**

**6:00 PM:**

Two types of sales reps:

1. "I'll find out what I made when I get paid"
2. "I know my commission to the dollar before the deal closes"

We built Comish for the second type.
(And to help the first type become the second.)

**9:00 AM:**
```
Commission math most reps get wrong:

You're at $340K. Quota is $375K.
Tier 1: 6% | Tier 2: 8%
A $50K deal closes.

Most reps: $50K × 6% = $3,000

Reality:
$35K to quota × 6% = $2,100
$15K above × 8% = $1,200
Total: $3,300

That's 10% more.
```

**1:00 PM:**
```
"Finance will figure it out"

Finance is processing hundreds of reps.
You are tracking one: you.

Are you calculating commission wrong?

Most sales reps make this mistake 👇

The scenario:
• Current revenue: $340,000
• Quota: $375,000  
• New deal: $50,000
• Tier 1 (0-100%): 6%
• Tier 2 (100-125%): 8%

❌ Wrong: $50K × 6% = $3,000
✓ Right: $35K × 6% + $15K × 8% = $3,300

That's $300 more on one deal.

Are you doing the math wrong? 🧮

Most reps calculate at one rate. But deals that cross tiers get split.

### Twitter/X ⭐ - THREAD DAY

**9:00 AM - Thread:**
```
🧵 Commission math that most sales reps get wrong:

Why you might be underpaid (and not know it) 👇
```
```
1/ Let's say your comp plan looks like this:

Tier 1 (0-100% quota): 6%
Tier 2 (100-125%): 8%
Tier 3 (125-150%): 10%
Tier 4 (150%+): 12%

Seems straightforward. Here's where it gets tricky...
```
```
2/ You're at $340K for the quarter.
Quota is $375K. That's 91% attainment.

A $50K deal just closed.

What's your commission on that deal?
```
```
3/ Most reps would say:

$50K × 6% = $3,000

Because you're in Tier 1, so everything is at 6%, right?

Wrong.
```
```
4/ The deal CROSSES the tier threshold.

$35K fills you to $375K (100%) → 6% = $2,100
$15K is ABOVE quota (Tier 2) → 8% = $1,200

Total: $3,300

That's $300 more than most reps calculate.
```
```
5/ Multiply this across every deal, every quarter.

You're either:
a) Leaving money on the table
b) Getting underpaid and not knowing it

This is why tracking matters.

We built comish.online to do this math automatically.
```

**2:00 PM:**
```
Real conversation:

Finance: "Your commission is $4,200"
Rep: "My tracker says $4,850"
Finance: "Let me check... you're right"

Happens more than you think.
```

### LinkedIn Company Page (9:00 AM)

😎 "I know my commission to the dollar"
• Makes better decisions

Which one are you?

5 comp plan red flags 🚩

1. "Effective commission rate" = hiding real numbers
2. Retroactive quota changes = moving goalposts  
3. Paid on "collected" revenue = delayed payment
4. Clawbacks beyond 90 days = punishment
5. "Up to X%" = almost nobody earns it

What did we miss?
```

**2:00 PM:**
```
Unpopular opinion:

Complex comp plans aren't designed to motivate you.
