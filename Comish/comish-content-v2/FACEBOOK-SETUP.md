## Content Strategy

### What to Post
Facebook is your lowest priority. Just repurpose:

| Day | Content |
|-----|---------|
| Monday | Same graphic as LinkedIn |
| Wednesday | Same graphic as LinkedIn |
| Friday | Same graphic as LinkedIn |

### How to Post

**Option 1: Manual**
- Just share the same image + caption from LinkedIn
- Shorten the caption slightly (FB users scan more)

**Option 2: Cross-post from Instagram**
- When you post to IG, select "Share to Facebook"
- Automatic, zero extra effort

### Engagement

- Reply to any comments (rare but important)
- Don't expect much organic reach - FB is pay-to-play
- Focus energy on LinkedIn and Twitter instead

---

## Facebook Groups Strategy

More valuable than your business page:

### Groups to Join
Search for and join these types of groups:
- "Sales Professionals"
- "B2B Sales"
- "SaaS Sales"
- "SDR/BDR Community"
- "Account Executive"
- "Sales Development"
- "Tech Sales"

### How to Engage

1. **Don't spam** - Never post "Check out my product!" That gets you banned
2. **Add value first** - Answer questions, share insights
3. **Mention naturally** - When someone asks about tracking commission, you can mention what you built
4. **DM interested people** - If someone seems interested, message them directly

### Example Group Comment
When someone posts about comp plan confusion:
```
I had this exact problem. Spent 3 hours one month just trying to calculate my commission. 

What helped me was breaking it down tier by tier - most people calculate the whole deal at one rate, but deals that cross thresholds get split.

I actually built a tool to handle this automatically. Happy to share if you're interested.
```

This is helpful, authentic, and opens the door without being spammy.

## Ads (Future - Not Now)

Don't run Facebook ads yet. Wait until you have:
- 50+ paying customers
- Clear messaging that converts
- Budget of $500+ to test properly

When ready, Facebook ads can work well for:
- Retargeting website visitors
- Lookalike audiences of customers
- Sales rep interest targeting
