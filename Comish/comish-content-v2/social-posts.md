### Post 1: The Problem
```
I spent 3 hours last month building a spreadsheet to figure out my commission.

3 hours.

Not selling. Not prospecting. Not closing.

Just trying to understand what I was getting paid.

My comp plan has 4 tiers, different rates for 1-year vs 2-year deals, and accelerators that kick in at 125% attainment.

I asked finance for a breakdown. They sent me a PDF that raised more questions than it answered.

So I did what any frustrated sales rep would do:

I built my own tracker.

Started as a Google Sheet. Then a Notion database. Then I realized other reps have this exact same problem.

Now it's called Comish.

You enter your comp plan once. Log your deals. And it tells you exactly what you're getting paid—broken down by tier, by deal, by quarter.

No more guessing. No more spreadsheets. No more "I'll find out when the check hits."

If you've ever felt that frustration, you're not alone.

### Post 2: The Math
```
Quick math for my sales friends:

You're at $340K for the quarter.
Your quota is $375K.
You're at 91% attainment.

Your comp plan:
- Tier 1 (0-100%): 6%
- Tier 2 (100-125%): 8%  
- Tier 3 (125-150%): 10%
- Tier 4 (150%+): 12%

A $50K deal just came in.

What's your commission on that deal?

Most reps would say: "$3,000" (6% of $50K)

Wrong.

Here's the real math:
- $35K fills you to quota (6%) = $2,100
- $15K is at Tier 2 rates (8%) = $1,200
- Total: $3,300

That's $300 more than you thought.

Now multiply that across a full year of deals.

This is why tracking matters.

### Post 3: Red Flags
```
5 comp plan red flags every sales rep should know:

1. "Effective commission rate" instead of actual rates
They're hiding the math. Ask for the real numbers.

2. Retroactive quota changes mid-quarter
If they can move the goalposts, your accelerators mean nothing.

3. Commission paid on "collected revenue" not closed revenue
You closed it in March. Customer pays in June. You might be gone by then.

4. Clawbacks beyond 90 days
Churn happens. But 6-month clawbacks are punishment, not policy.

5. "Up to" language everywhere
"Earn up to 15% commission" means almost nobody earns 15%.

Your comp plan is a contract. Read it like one.

### Post 4: Relatable Pain
```
Sales rep inner monologue after closing a big deal:

"Nice, $80K deal, 2-year contract."

"Wait, what's my rate on 2-year deals again?"

"Am I at Tier 2 yet this quarter?"

"Does this count toward Q4 or Q1?"

"Is this enough to hit accelerators?"

"What am I actually getting paid on this?"

*opens spreadsheet*

*stares at spreadsheet*

*closes spreadsheet*

"I'll figure it out when I get paid."

Sound familiar?

### Post 5: Build in Public
```
I'm building a SaaS and I'm going to be honest about it.

It's called Comish. Commission tracking for sales reps.

Why I built it:
- I was tired of not knowing what I was getting paid
- Spreadsheets suck
- Finance never has answers when you need them

Current stats:
- [X] users
- $5/month pricing
- Built it myself in nights and weekends

What I've learned so far:
- Sales reps HATE their comp plans (not the money, the complexity)
- Everyone has a spreadsheet. Everyone hates their spreadsheet.
- "Just trust payroll" isn't good enough

I'll be sharing the journey here. The wins, the fails, the numbers.

If you're building something too, let's connect.

## Twitter/X Posts (Short-form)

### Thread 1: Commission Math
```
Tweet 1:
Sales reps are leaving money on the table because they don't understand their own comp plan.

Here's a thread on commission math that most reps get wrong: 🧵

Tweet 2:
Scenario:
- You're at $340K (quota is $375K)
- Tier 1: 6% (0-100%)
- Tier 2: 8% (100-125%)
- A $50K deal closes

What's your commission?

Tweet 3:
Most reps say $3,000 (6% × $50K)

Wrong.

Tweet 4:
Real math:
- $35K fills you to 100% → 6% = $2,100
- $15K is at Tier 2 → 8% = $1,200
- Total: $3,300

That's 10% more than you thought.

Tweet 5:
Multiply this across every deal, every quarter, every year.

You're either:
a) Leaving money on the table
b) Getting underpaid and not knowing it

Track your commission. Know your numbers.

### Single Tweets (Engagement)
```
Tweet A:
Sales reps: How long did it take you to understand your comp plan?

Me: I'm on year 3 and still not sure.

---

Tweet B:
Hot take: If your comp plan requires a finance degree to understand, it's designed that way on purpose.

---

Tweet C:
The spreadsheet every sales rep has but pretends they don't:

"Commission Tracker (FINAL) (v3) (USE THIS ONE).xlsx"

---

Tweet D:
Two types of sales reps:

1. "I'll find out what I made when I get paid"
2. "I know my commission to the dollar before the deal even closes"

Be the second one.

---

Tweet E:
Just spent 45 minutes trying to figure out if I hit accelerators this quarter.

This is why I built @comaborrar.

---

Tweet F:
Your comp plan is a contract.

Read it like one.
Understand it like one.
Track it like one.

---

Tweet G:
Finance: "Your commission will be $4,200"
Me: "My spreadsheet says $4,850"
Finance: "Let me check... you're right"

This happens more than you think.
